# DevSketch Mobile - Flutter Export Structure

When exporting a generated Flutter project, the following structure is created:

```
devsketch_generated/
├── lib/
│   ├── main.dart              # App entry point (from main_template.dart)
│   └── generated_page.dart    # Generated UI code
├── pubspec.yaml               # Dependencies (from pubspec_template.yaml)
├── analysis_options.yaml      # Linting rules (optional)
└── README.md                  # Project readme
```

## File Descriptions

### main.dart
- Material 3 themed app wrapper
- Light/dark mode support
- Consistent styling for buttons, text fields
- Imports and displays the generated page

### generated_page.dart
- Contains the AI-generated Flutter widgets
- Stateful widget with proper lifecycle
- SafeArea + SingleChildScrollView wrapper
- Column layout with responsive widgets

### pubspec.yaml
- Flutter 3.0+ compatible
- Material design enabled
- Minimal dependencies for portability

## Export Options

1. **Full Project** - Complete Flutter project, ready to run
2. **Code Only** - Just the generated_page.dart content
3. **Clipboard** - Copy code to clipboard for pasting

## Running the Generated Project

flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Customization Points

After export, developers typically customize:
- Colors in ThemeData
- Button actions (onPressed callbacks)
- TextField controllers and validation
- Navigation between pages
- State management integration
